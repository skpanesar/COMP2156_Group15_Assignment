With three campuses located in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology is a public, fully accredited institution of applied arts and technology. George Brown College was founded by the Ontario government in 1966 and opened its doors the following year, much like many other institutions in the province.
In order to provide apprentice training on behalf of the province Department of Labour, the college's forerunner, the province Institute of Trades (PIT), was established in 1951. The PIT started out at 21 Nassau Street in Toronto's Kensington Market in 1952. By 1961, it had grown to include two more buildings on the property and was providing programmes in welding, watchmaking, diesel mechanics, barbering, lathe and structural steel, and jewellery arts. At 555 Davenport Road, next to Casa Loma, the province established the Provincial Institute of Trades and Occupations (PITO), a sibling training facility, in 1962.
